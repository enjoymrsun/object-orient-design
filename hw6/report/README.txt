As the compression ratio increases from 0% to around 65%, the image size gets changed 
but not necessarily decreased and the visual difference is not significant 
compared with the original image. 

As the compression ratio increases from 65% to around 90%, the image size gets decreased 
to some extent but the visual difference is not significant 
compared with the original image. 

Only when the ratio begins from 90% to 99%, the size of image reduces significantly 
and the visual difference becomes noticeable.

So we think itâ€™s better to compress images with ratio around 90% 
for better visual result and relative small file size.
